# Bozorgrah - Goal and Task Management System

## Introduction

**Bozorgrah** is a web-based platform designed to help users set and achieve their goals by generating, managing, and tracking the tasks required to reach those goals. By entering a simple goal as text, the system uses intelligent algorithms to automatically define the necessary tasks and sub-tasks and assist users throughout their journey to completion.
